1) THEORY
The dictionary definition of theory is: “a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.”
Ultimately a theory is only useful in it’s ability to understand, predict or manipulate reality
Reality for all intents and purposes is physical, the people, places and things in the physical universe is what most people agree is reality
The only reason people take scientist and engineers seriously is their ability to predict reality, like weather patterns for example, or to manipulate reality, like the creation of the smartphone
Once a theory can accurately predict reality it becomes a belief
Once a theory can accurately manipulate reality it becomes a thing
A theory is the lowest level of certainty
2) BELIEFS
The dictionary definition of belief is: “an acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof.”
I believe World War 2 happened, but I don’t know for sure, I wasn’t there
But I also believe that a lot of our history is deliberate misinformation, because history is written by the winners, who have a massive motivation to control the narrative
A belief is the middle level of certainty
3) KNOWLEDGE
Knowledge is: “awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.”
The key measurement for knowledge is experience: “for example, I know I’m communicating to you right now either through my website or my youtube channel” (excluding the theory we live in a simulation)
Knowledge is the highest level of certainty, when you’re certain you know\
So the questions become:
Are my theories serving me by allowing to create a better life?
Are my beliefs accurate or am I limiting my potential by limiting my beliefs and mistaking those beliefs for knowledge and certainty?
